Overpower (formerly "Planet Attack!") is a multiplayer simultanious-action turn-based hex-grid game of conquering a galaxy.

The tech used is postgres database for persistance, simple html for UI served over http, and cookie based login/logouts.  It is all terribly insecure.

Heavy migration/redesign in progress.

Overpower is for 2-8 players, played out over several days.  When all players have submitted their orders for the turn, or some time limit is met, all orders are executed and the next turn begins.  The game starts with each player in control of one planet on the rim of a large galaxy, and on each turn the players may construct space ships to travel to and colonize more planets.
